# *Here we run tests*
# We prefer running tests in the 'before_script' section rather than 'script' to ensure fast failure.
# Be aware that if you use the 'script' section it will continue running all commands in the section even if one line fails.
# This is documented at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Breaking-the-Build
# We don't want this behavior because otherwise we might risk publishing builds when the tests did not pass.
# For this reason, we disable the 'script' section below, since we prefer using 'before_script'.
before_script:
  - npm test
  # after successful tests, publish binaries if specified in commit message
  - ./scripts/publish.sh --toolset=${TOOLSET:-} --debug=$([ "${BUILDTYPE}" == 'debug' ] && echo "true" || echo "false")

# We set 'script' here to an empty array to prevent this section from automatically running 'npm test'
# The reason we do this is mentioned above in the comment about the 'before_script' stage.
# For reference, the default travis behavior which we override comes from https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/blob/e5a45cbf49e0d9e27398e76e5f25dd7706feb6aa/lib/travis/build/script/node_js.rb#L62-L69.
